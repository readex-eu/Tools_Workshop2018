\section{Extensions} \label{sec:extensions}

READEX provides additional means for tuning the energy efficiency of applications extending the presented concepts. These cover the tuning of application level parameters which select different algorithms, for example, and provide a significant extension of the tuning parameter space. Application-level tuning parameters can either be declared in the program code but also be tuned if they are passed to the program via the input files. READEX also supports the construction of a generic tuning model from tuning models for program runs with different inputs. The last extension presented here covers runtime tuning for situation that were not seen during design-time called calibration.
