\section{Extensions} \label{sec:extensions}

READEX provides additional means for tuning the energy-efficiency of applications by extending the presented concepts. These cover the tuning of application-level parameters that may be used to select different algorithms and change the control flow, and provide a significant extension of the tuning parameter space. Application-level tuning parameters can either be declared in the program code or be tuned by passing them to the program via the input files, as described in Sections~\ref{sec:atp} and~\ref{sec:acp}. READEX also supports the construction of a generic tuning model from individual tuning models generated for program runs with different inputs, and is described in Section~\ref{sec:input}. Section~\ref{sec:calibration} presents the runtime calibration extension that covers tuning for rts's that were not seen during design-time.
