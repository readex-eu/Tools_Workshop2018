The European Union Horizon 2020 READEX project uses an online approach to exploit application dynamism and tune large-scale HPC applications to improve energy efficiency and performance. The paper presents the READEX methodology, consisting of the Design-Time Analysis and Runtime Application Tuning, and describes the pre-analysis steps involving application dynamism and significant region detection. During design-time, the READEX tuning plugin evaluates configurations of hardware and software tuning parameters to determine the best settings for instances of application regions. The runtime tuning dynamically switches to the best configuration for an application region during production runs. Finally, the energy savings obtained for LULESH on the Taurus supercomputer highlight the effectiveness of this methodology."

abstract = {Summary In this paper, we propose an energy-aware task management mechanism designed for the forward-in-time algorithms running on multicore central processing units (CPUs), where the multidimensional positive definite advection transport algorithm stencil-based algorithm is one of the representative examples. This mechanism is based on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling technique and allows the reduction of energy consumption for an existing algorithm (or application) such that the predefined execution time is respected, without requiring any modifications in the algorithm itself. This paper also provides the formulation of a method for minimizing the energy consumption with time constraints, which is based on the adaptive scheduling with online modeling. Finally, using the autotuning technique, we provide the automation of the process for creation and determination of the best energy profile at runtime, even in the presence of additional CPU workloads. The experimental results on a 6-core computing platform show that the proposed mechanism provides the energy savings of up to 1.43x when compared to the default Linux scaling governor. Also, we confirm the effectiveness of the self-adaptive feature of the proposed mechanism, by showing its ability to maintain the requested execution time in spite of additional CPU workloads imposed by other applications.}

abstract="The power scaling challenge associated with Exascale systems is a well-known issue. In this work, we introduce the Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM): a tree-hierarchical, open source runtime framework we are contributing to the HPC community to foster increased collaboration and accelerated progress toward software-hardware co-designed energy management solutions that address Exascale power challenges and improve performance and energy efficiency in current systems. Through its plugin extensible architecture, GEOPM enables rapid prototyping of new energy management strategies. Different plugins can be tailored to the specific performance or energy efficiency priorities of each HPC center. To demonstrate the potential of the framework, this work develops an example plugin for GEOPM. This power rebalancing plugin targets power-capped systems and improves efficiency by minimizing job time-to-solution within a power budget. Our results demonstrate up to 30{\%} improvements in the time-to-solution of CORAL system procurement benchmarks on a Xeon Phi cluster.",

	performs clustering using DBSCAN for normalized PAPI
	metrics, and computes the best tuning parameter settings
	for each cluster. It verifies the cluster analysis results, and
