\textcolor{blue}{General focus:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item This paper does not go into technical details, but aims to provide a general guide to interested users about what they can expect if they use READEX for energy tuning and the rational.
  \item Implementation aspects only if really necessary to understand what happens in the steps.
  \item No syntax examples, only if absolutely necessary.
  \item Very few pictures.
  \item Focus on motivating how things are done, what is the rational to use certain concepts and why he should take certain decisions, e.g., selection of search space of parameters should be done carefully to not run into a search explosion, where to put the phase region, what to do if there is inter-phase dynamism ...

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
\textbf{TUM (2 pages)} \\ \\
\textcolor{blue}{1. Motivation for energy saving \\
2. Challenges for exascale computing \\
3. Introduction to the solution - READEX \\
4. Score-P, PTF and RRL (short background) \\
5. Introduce tuning parameters. Details about the frequencies and threads tuning parameters.  \\
6. Introduce regions, rts's. Ignore interphase here. \\
7. Different rts's have different best configurations. \\
8. Say that this paper does not go into technical details, but aims to provide a general guide to interested users about what they can expect if they use READEX for energy tuning and the rational. }
