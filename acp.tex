\subsection{Application Configuration Parameters} \label{sec:acp}

Application-level tuning parameters are frequently part of the application input, and are given in the input files configuring the program run. To tune those Application Configuration Parameters (ACP), READEX provides an additional tuning plugin. 

The \texttt{readex\_configuration} tuning plugin enables tuning of ACPs with respect to one of the objectives supported by READEX. The plugin first reads a plugin specific configuration file. This specifies the objective, the search algorithms, and the tuning parameters. ACPs are identified by their name in the input file. For each such input file, a template file with the name is given. During the search for the optimal configuration of the ACPs, the plugin copies the template file to the input file and replaces all ACP names with the value given in the selected configuration. It then restarts the application and measures the resulting objective value for the phase region. Typically, only a single phase is required to measure the resulting objective value, but a burst of phases can also be used in a single experiment. 

The final outcome of this tuning plugin is an optimal configuration for the ACPs that is output into a file. Furthermore, final input files are created from the template files by replacing ACPs by their value in the best configuration.
