\subsection{Input Identifiers} \label{sec:input}
\textbf{TUM and NTNU (1 page)}
\textcolor{blue}{
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Motivation
	\item Explain how input identifiers are given in separate file.
	\item Talk about handling of processes/threads
	\item Tuning model merging
\end{enumerate}}
DTA is executed to observe the characteristic variations for different input sets. This helps the user to improve the tuning model by identifiying more rts's due to variations in application executions. The application executions are identified via input identifiers in the form of key-value pairs in a separate file.
