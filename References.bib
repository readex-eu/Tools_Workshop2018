I present the results of a broad survey of memory bandwidth and machine balance for a large variety of current computers, including uniprocessors, vector processors, shared-memory systems, and districuted-memory systems. The results are analyzed in terms of the sustainable data transfer rates for uncached unit-stride vector operation for each machine, and for each class.},

  abstract  = {Multimedia applications are expected to form the largest portion of workload in general purpose PC and portable devices. The ever-increasing computation intensity of multimedia applications elevates the processor temperature and consequently impairs the reliability and performance of the system. In this paper, we propose to perform dynamic thermal management using reinforcement learning algorithm for multimedia applications. The proposed learning model does not need any prior knowledge of the workload information or the system thermal and power characteristics. It learns the temperature change and workload switching patterns by observing the temperature sensor and event counters on the processor, and finds the management policy that provides good performance-thermal tradeoff during the runtime. We validated our model on a Dell personal computer with Intel Core 2 processor. Experimental results show that our approach provides considerable performance improvements with marginal increase in the percentage of thermal hotspot comparing to existing workload phase detection approach.},

Scalability results for the assembly of system matrices sparsified by the adaptive cross approximation are also presented.},

  abstract  = {The power scaling challenge associated with Exascale systems is a well-known issue. In this work, we introduce the Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM): a tree-hierarchical, open source runtime framework we are contributing to the HPC community to foster increased collaboration and accelerated progress toward software-hardware co-designed energy management solutions that address Exascale power challenges and improve performance and energy efficiency in current systems. Through its plugin extensible architecture, GEOPM enables rapid prototyping of new energy management strategies. Different plugins can be tailored to the specific performance or energy efficiency priorities of each HPC center. To demonstrate the potential of the framework, this work develops an example plugin for GEOPM. This power rebalancing plugin targets power-capped systems and improves efficiency by minimizing job time-to-solution within a power budget. Our results demonstrate up to 30{\%} improvements in the time-to-solution of CORAL system procurement benchmarks on a Xeon Phi cluster.},
