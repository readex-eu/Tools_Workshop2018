\subsection{Application Tuning Parameters} \label{sec:atp}
\textbf{Intel (1 page)}
\textcolor{blue}{\begin{enumerate}
	\item Motivation
	\item How does this work? (A high level workflow, maybe?)
	\item Explain that ATPs are combined to domains and those in a domain can have constraints. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Manual insertion into code (ATP library). Can use runtime info to set e.g. the value space of an ATP.
		\item Pre DTA: Generation of ATP file
		\item During DTA: ATP server providing valid settings for ATPs based on the value space and the constraints.
		\item During RAT: Read by ATP library from the RRL
	\end{itemize}
