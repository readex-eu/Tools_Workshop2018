  \item No architecture diagram, maybe a simpler version?
  \item Dynamic switching motivation
  \item Works with standard ScoreP via substrate plugin
  \item RRL
  \item Switching back or not at the end of a region

The dynamic switching of tuning parameters is applied during the runtime application phase. This is performed by the Readex Runtime Library (RRL) which is implemented as a light weight library to keep the configuration switching overhead at minimum.

Once the DTA analysis is finished and the Tuning Model (TM) has been generated, the optimized application can be used in production.
