\begin{enumerate}
  \item Background and related work.
  \item Tuning DVFS well explored. 
  \item In general difficult due to permissions to read energy measurements and set frequencies, different interfaces, and lack of measurement hardware
  \item Tools available in practice? Energy aware scheduling at LRZ. Anything else?
  \item READEX based on ScoreP and Periscope, interfacing msrsave, libadapt, likwid
  \item READEX provides dynamic tuning in addition to static tuning
